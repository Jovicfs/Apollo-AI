# Welcome to the Apollo AI

## Overview

Apollo AI is an innovative artificial intelligence application designed to demonstrate the seamless integration of intelligent functionalities using modern technologies. This project utilizes the AI API for advanced AI capabilities, with a backend powered by Node.js and a minimalistic frontend built without any frameworks. The application efficiently fetches and manipulates data using the Groq API, ensuring robust and dynamic interactions across both backend and frontend components.

## Features

- **AI Integration**: Leverages the AI API for advanced data processing and intelligent features.
- **Node.js Backend**: Efficient and scalable server-side logic.
- **Framework-less Frontend**: Lightweight and fast user interface built without additional frontend frameworks.
- **Groq API**: Utilized for powerful data querying and manipulation.
- **MongoDB**: Integrated for secure and scalable data storage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node package manager, which comes with Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running. You can download it [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/apollo-ai.git
    cd apollo-ai
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Use npm to install the necessary dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your API keys, secrets, and MongoDB connection string. This ensures that sensitive information is kept secure and not hard-coded into your application.

    ```plaintext
    AI_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    PORT=3000
    ```

4. **Run the Application**

    Start the Node.js server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can start interacting with the AI-powered features. The frontend provides a simple interface to input data and receive intelligent responses, processed and fetched by the backend using the Groq API and stored/retrieved from MongoDB.

## Project Structure

  - **/backend**: Node.js server logic.
  - **/frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
