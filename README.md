# Welcome to the Apollo AI


My project is an artificial intelligence application built using the AI API, 
with Node.js for the backend and a frontend developed without any frameworks. 
The application leverages the power of Groq API to fetch and manipulate data, 
providing intelligent functionalities seamlessly integrated 
into both backend and frontend components.
